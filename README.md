A clean, free, and customizable crosshair overlay tool — an alternative to expensive apps like Crosshair X. Designed for gamers who want a minimal but effective aiming overlay.

## 🚀 Features

### 🖼️ Overlay Crosshair
- Always-on-top crosshair window
- Change color and size of the crosshair
- Customize position manually if needed
- Runs in **borderless**, transparent mode
- Invisible to anti-cheat (overlay only)

### 🔐 Key System
- A valid **activation key** is required
- Keys are generated via Discord bot and rotate every 3 days
- Program checks key validity on launch
- Keys are stored locally, no need to re-enter unless expired
- Secure comparison system (case-insensitive, format-agnostic)

### ⚙️ Settings
- Lightweight settings window
- No unnecessary options — focused UI
- Built with performance in mind

---

## 🛡️ Safe & Private

Kurumi’s Crosshair runs entirely **offline** after key validation. It does **not**:

- Monitor your keyboard/mouse
- Track your usage
- Send any personal data

All it does is draw a crosshair on your screen – nothing more, nothing less.

## 📦 How to Use

1. Launch the program.
2. Enter your key when prompted.
3. Select your crosshair style and color.

## 🧠 Troubleshooting

- ❌ _“Invalid key”_ → Make sure you copy the exact key sent via Discord (watch out for spaces).
- 🔄 If your key expired, request a new one with `!key` in the Discord.
- 🎮 Some fullscreen-exclusive games may not show the overlay — use **borderless windowed** mode.

## 🧾 Why Key-Based?

This app is completely free — but to avoid abuse, reuploads, or spam, it uses a simple rotating key system.
A new key is generated every **3 days** and shared via our Discord server.

You can get the key in two ways:

* 📌 Check the `#key` channel — the key is posted there regularly
* 🤖 Or DM the bot with `!key` to receive it privately
