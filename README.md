A clean, free, and customizable crosshair overlay tool — an alternative to expensive apps like Crosshair X. Designed for gamers who want a minimal but effective aiming overlay.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🖼️ Overlay Crosshair

* Always-on-top crosshair window
* Change color, size, and style of the crosshair
* Customize position manually if needed
* Runs in **borderless**, transparent mode
* Invisible to anti-cheat (overlay only)

### 🌐 Online Availability Check (New since 1.0.4)

* On startup, the app checks if the official GitHub repository still exists.  
* If the repository is unreachable, the app shows:  
  `"Program currently offline: repository not reachable."`  
* This replaces the old **Key System** from earlier versions.

### ⚙️ Settings

* Lightweight settings window
* Focused and minimal UI
* Built with performance in mind

## 💾 File Storage

All program data (settings, profiles, etc.) is stored locally in:

C:\Users<user>\AppData\Roaming\KurumiProjects

This ensures a clean installation directory while keeping your preferences safe and persistent.

---

## 🛡️ Safe & Private

Kurumi’s Crosshair runs entirely **offline** (after the quick repository check). It does **not**:

* Monitor your keyboard/mouse
* Track your usage
* Send any personal data

All it does is draw a crosshair on your screen – nothing more, nothing less.

## 📦 How to Use

1. Launch the program.  
2. Choose your crosshair style and color.  
3. Enjoy accurate aiming in every game.  

---

## 🧠 Troubleshooting

* ❌ Overlay not visible? → Make sure your game is running in **borderless windowed** mode.  
* 🎮 Some fullscreen-exclusive games may block overlays.
